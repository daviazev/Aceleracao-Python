# üêç Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Python Learning Journey** repository! This project documents my progress as I study Python programming over the next few months. The goal is to build a strong foundation in Python, debug strategies, object-oriented programming, web scraping, Flask, and Django. By the end of this journey, I'll have gained enough knowledge to confidently work on Django projects.

## üåü Overview

This repository is organized into six main modules, each containing exercises, projects, and learning materials. Each module explores a different topic, ranging from debugging and object-oriented programming to web scraping and Django development.

### üìö Modules

1. **Debug with Python**
   - Learn debugging strategies and tools for Python.
   - Automate testing with PyTest.
   - Build a profiler project.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Understand the fundamentals of OOP in Python.
   - Explore design principles like abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
   - Create a project called *Inventory Report*.

3. **Web Scraping**
   - Scrape data from web pages using Python libraries.
   - Work with tools like MongoDB and build crawlers.
   - Complete a project called *TechNews*.

4. **Flask**
   - Set up APIs and server-side rendering in Flask.
   - Dive into templates and API testing.
   - Finish with a project called *Traduzo*.

5. **Django**
   - Build a database-driven application using Django ORM.
   - Explore Django templates, forms, and APIs.
   - Complete a project named *Spot News*.

6. **Django 2**
   - Implement authentication and testing in Django apps.
   - Deploy an application using Railway.
   - End with a portfolio project named *Super Portfolio*.
